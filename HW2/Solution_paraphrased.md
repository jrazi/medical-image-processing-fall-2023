### Problem 1 Discussion

Consider a small-scale matrix, specifically a 2x2 construct. By examining the sum of the elements along certain angles, we infer the individual values:

- **Horizontal Summation**: Summing horizontally yields 10 for the top pair and 7 for the bottom pair.
- **Diagonal Summation (Top-Left to Bottom-Right)**: The lone top-left value is 7, the middle sum is 8, and the bottom-right stands alone at 2.
- **Vertical Summation**: Vertically, the left column adds up to 12, while the right sums to 5.
- **Diagonal Summation (Bottom-Left to Top-Right)**: The bottom-left is 5, the central sum is 9, and the top-right is 3.

By interlinking these sums, we deduce the individual elements, yielding a matrix with elements 7, 3, 5, and 2.

### Interpretation of Computed Tomography (CT)

When interpreting CT scans, the pixel intensity reflects tissue radiodensity, gauged in Hounsfield units. Without a calibration scale, we can hypothesize that the matrix's larger numbers suggest denser tissue, such as bone, and smaller numbers indicate softer tissue or air.

### Challenges of Backprojection in Image Reconstruction

Backprojection, while foundational to image reconstruction, faces significant hurdles:

- **Computational Demand**: It requires intensive calculations for each pixel, iterating across all angles, making it slow and resource-intensive.
- **Noise Sensitivity**: Even minor noise can cause major artifacts, compromising the image's diagnostic value.
- **Memory Footprint**: Storing extensive projection data necessitates substantial memory, posing a challenge for larger or 3D data sets.

Advanced methods like filtered backprojection and iterative reconstruction, though more computationally demanding, offer better image fidelity and noise robustness.

### Problem 2 Analysis

**MRI Contrast Dynamics**:
MRI contrast emerges from the disparity in tissue relaxation times. Varying molecular structures yield distinct T1 and T2 relaxation times, enabling specific tissue imaging by adjusting scan parameters.

**MRI Signal Equation**:
A simple equation \( S(t) = e^{-t/T_{2_s}} \) models the signal decay over time without rotational components, assuming a steady decay determined by the substance's characteristic T2* value.

**MRI Frequency Determination**:
The Larmor equation relates precession frequency to magnetic field strength. For a 3.2 T field, the frequency for hydrogen's gyromagnetic ratio is 136 MHz.

### Problem 3 Exploration

For three different materials with varying absorption profiles, the transmitted radiation intensity can be mathematically represented. Integrating over the material's length, we can calculate the remaining intensity for each material, ultimately giving us a formula for the intensity after traversing all three.

### Problem 4 Review

**PET-CT Technology Advancement**:
Modern PET-CT systems boast enhancements like heightened detector sensitivity and resolution, improved lesion detectability, and reduced noise, all while allowing for quicker scans or lower radiation doses without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy.

**Research Paper Synopsis**:
The paper discusses generating high-dose quality PET images from ultra-low-dose scans via a deep learning network, evaluating the synthetic images' quality and lesion visibility through metrics like SSIM, PSNR, and MAE.

### Problem 5 Examination

**Ultrasound Modes**:

- **A-Mode**: Provides one-dimensional depth profiles ideal for distance measurements and identifying abnormalities.
- **B-Mode**: Offers two-dimensional images for a detailed anatomical review, being the most common ultrasound technique.
- **M-Mode**: Captures sequential A-mode or B-mode images, akin to a video, to analyze movement and velocity of organs over time.

Each mode serves distinct purposes, chosen based on the specific diagnostic requirement.

### Problem 6 Insights

**Adversarial Attacks in Medical Imaging**:
Adversarial inputs can deceive neural networks, with common radiological noise types acting as inadvertent adversarial perturbations that disrupt network performance.

**Data Set Challenges and Solutions**:
Annotated medical image data is rare, costly, and ethically sensitive. Solutions include synthetic data generation, domain adaptation techniques, and privacy-preserving data sharing methods.

**Beyond Quantitative Metrics**:
Quantitative metrics fail to illuminate a model's decision-making process. Visual explainability techniques, like CAM and LIME, provide insights into the model's focus and logic, enhancing user understanding and model refinement.

**Explainability Methods**

:
Model agnostic methods offer wide applicability at the potential cost of specificity, while model-specific methods provide detailed explanations tailored to a particular model's architecture.
